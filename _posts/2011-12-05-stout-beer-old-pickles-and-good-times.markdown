We got out and about quite a bit this weekend. Friday night, we headed to [Sidetrack](http://www.sidetrackbarandgrill.com/) in downtown Ypsilanti. I love coming to Sidetrack around Christmastime, as it's one of the most cozy places in town. Strong, stout beer served up with a side of traditional bar fare makes it fun for the whole fam.

And of course, no trip to Ann Arbor would be complete without a stop at [Zingerman's](http://www.zingermans.com/)! Ann Arbor's most favorite deli is always packed, and always good.

On the weekends, there's always a line around the corner, but it's worth it to have the chance to eat your weight in corned beef, pimento cheese, old pickles and latkes.
