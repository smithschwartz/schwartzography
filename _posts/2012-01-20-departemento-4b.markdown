Doorbell rings.  

"Aren't you gonna get that?" he says, upstairs.

Scrunchy face.

"We don't know anyone here." 

Pause.

Again, doorbell rings.

I answer the intercom, "Hola?"

"Hola... bla bla bla algo en español que no entiendo..."

"No sé." 

I quickly hang up the receiver. 

"What did he say?"

"Something in Spanish I didn't understand, so I said I don't know and hung up."

Scrunchy face.

"Good thing you answered the doorbell."

Chuckles.

"Yes, good thing."
