Happy Friday the 13th! Here's to hoping you'll stay away from cats and rickety ladders today. 

We read some fun stuff on the internet this week:

I'm not sure what I like more, watching Mad Men, or reading Tom and Lorenzo's [Mad Style](http://www.tomandlorenzo.com/2012/04/mad-style-mystery-date.html), their take on Janie Bryant's amazing costuming work on the show. TLo (as their fans call them), have a way of noticing the tiniest details of the show, and tying it all together in unexpected ways. Fabulously nerdy.

Speaking of fabulous nerds, this week I came across New York-based designer Tien-Min Liao's [Handmade Type](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Handmade-Type/3235741) and it kind of blew my mind.

And if you're into just plain old nerd-nerds, you've got to check out this Kickstarter project from [Pebble](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android). Their goal of raising $100,000 was met about 20 minutes after launching and now they're at $2 million and counting! Check out the dudes themselves at about 22 seconds in. We re-wound and watched them run in about 30 times. Nice watch, indeed.

If you're looking to feed some nerds, [here](http://www.amateurgourmet.com/2011/08/caramelized_cauliflower_with_oranges_oli.html)'s an interesting lunch I made this week.

Happy weekend! We're off to tour some 'smart' homes and attend a crawfish boil. See you next week.
