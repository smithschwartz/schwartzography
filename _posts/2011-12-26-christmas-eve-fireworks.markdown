Celebrating Christmas in the middle of summer brings all kinds of surprises. Instead of frosted windowpanes or roasted chestnuts, we stayed up to watch the fireworks!

Some were closer than others...

At midnight, Porteños begin shooting off fireworks (and firearms) all over the city. This serious celebration went on in full force for about two hours and trickled on throughout the night. Luckily for us we had quite the panoramic view.

Even our next door neighbors got in on the action!

This kind of celebration definitely made Christmas feel more like a community holiday than one of hunkering down like we're used to. The fireworks brought everyone out into the streets to cheer and celebrate together. Felices Fiestas, everyone!
