So, I haven't even thought about making let alone selling a painting in over 5 years, but it's amazing what you have time for when you're unemployed! My sister-in-law mentioned an art auction fundraiser for a local non-profit so I thought, hey, why not? It was all for a good cause, and it's always nice to add a little cash to your pockets. Of course I forgot to take a proper photo, but I found one on the event's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150909829450538.753151.201914565537&type=3).

You can see most of the painting here. My guess is that these two had a nasty bidding war over my piece before one of them finally bought it. I'm pretty sure it was _the_ hot ticket item.
