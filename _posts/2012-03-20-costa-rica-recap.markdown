Good morning! During our last leg of international-ness, we spent two week's with Erik's work buddies at [Table XI](http://www.tablexi.com) in Costa Rica! ¡Que linda!

While plenty of work happened (here's a shot of Erik giving a fascinating tech talk!), there was also lots of sightseeing and hanging out in paradise with a great group of people. It was a delight for us to be around people we've known for quite some time instead of constantly meeting new folks.

Costa Rica really is rich in resources. We saw some of the most incredible landscapes we're ever had the chance to be around on this trip.

The flora and fauna was absolutely amazing. Pop quiz! is this a plant or an animal?

And this one? Obvi, it's a horse.

We spent our first week-and-a-half at the beach, but headed up into the mountains for the last few days.

Here, we hung out in some of the world's largest hot tubs, filled with mineral water from natural hot springs!

It seemed that just as we'd [arrived](http://schwartzography.com/2012/03/a-small-plane-is-a-big-deal/), it was time to leave. We'll always have a special place in our hearts for the Pura Vida of Costa Rica.
