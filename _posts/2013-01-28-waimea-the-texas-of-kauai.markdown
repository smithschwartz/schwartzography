After a [few soggy days](http://schwartzography.com/from-red-mud-to-roosters-touchdown-in-kauai/) on Kauai, we were desperately seeking sunshine. We had moved on from the industrial seaside town of Lihue to the lush, fertile hillsides of Lawai Valley. It's a strikingly beautiful area, but since it is 'wintertime' on the island, it rains almost all the time.

Our gracious host, Traci at the [Strawberry Guava Bed and Breakfast](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60615-d591302-Reviews-Strawberry_Guava_Bed_and_Breakfast-Kalaheo_Kauai_Hawaii.html), told us to head west to bottommost corner of Kauai. It's almost always sunny and warm there, so we threw some sunscreen in a bag, drove west and wound up in the sleepy but sunny town of Waimea.

There was just something about this town, the clapboard buildings, the heavy-lidded overhangs and the steadfast sun above that gave me that good ol' Texas feeling.

Maybe it's because we're living on the road, or maybe it's just a game I've always played in my head, but I love looking for the familiar in the new. It reminds me that we're all connected, somehow and that any place can feel a bit like home.
