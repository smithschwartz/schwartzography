Get right outta town! Indeed that's what we're about to do. With one final empanada we close the oven door on a very interesting and eventful 2 months in Buenos Aires.

To recap, we've had some excellent estadounidense visitors:

We learned the word "[estadounidense](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=estadounidense)" among other essential but very difficult-to-pronounce words. Thankfully Spanish started to feel less booby-trapped over time and we were able to participate in conversations that would get a smart three year-old a nice pat on the head. To certify our excellence (Smith's anyway), the country of Argentina conspired to present us with this official endorsement:

We thank the president and the mayor and everyone else who set aside their differences to help us roll our R's.

But language and location-specifics aside, this period has been an interesting proof-of-concept for our new endeavor and we've grown a lot in the process. A few lessons we've learned:



	
  * Working in this fashion is quite doable. We've stayed in touch and connected pretty seamlessly.

	
  * In fact, even beyond work we've been surprisingly industrious with our time thanks to the next point:

	
  * Two months is a bit long for quick social connections and a bit short for the real deal. We met many great people that we hope to see again. On the other hand we also spent a decent amount of quiet time at home chomping empanadas and working. We're enjoying our various projects so it's been a good thing but in the future we'll know that dropping ourselves in a foreign land for 2 months will tip the scales towards work rather than play.


All in all we're ready to move on from Buenos Aires, bittersweet as it is. The city often [surprised](http://graffitimundo.com/), occasionally disappointed (overcooked eggs and raw onion ain't a green salad mis amigos), but mostly served as a picturesque backdrop against which we came to understand the benefits and drawbacks of our new lifestyle. We're feeling pretty energized/focused after our time here and look forward to taking on new challenges and seeing some familiar faces soon. See you in Panama!
